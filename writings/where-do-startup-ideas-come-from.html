                <h2>1. Solving Your Own Problem</h2>
                <p>Often, great ideas come from founders solving their own problems.<br>
                Take Airbnb, for example. In 2008, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia struggled to pay rent for their apartment. They decided to rent out part of their space to guests, offering an affordable alternative to hotels—especially during large events when accommodation was scarce and overpriced. What started as a personal solution turned into a company that reshaped travel and hospitality.<br>
                However, not every problem-solution leads to a startup. If your idea doesn't require building a company, raising investments, or creating financial value, it's likely not a startup in the traditional sense.<br>
                For instance, Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005 because existing version control systems, like SVN, were centralized, slow, and unsuitable for the distributed development of the Linux kernel. Git wasn't designed as a business but became the foundation for startups like GitHub and GitLab.</p>
                <h2>2. Right Idea, Right Time</h2>
                <p>Sometimes, an idea has been around for years, but its time has only just come. New technology, shifting trends, or greater accessibility can finally make it viable.<br>
                History is full of examples of ideas that failed because they were too early:<br>
                Electric cars appeared before the 20th century and gained traction until the mass production of gasoline cars made them obsolete. Now, with changing trends and technology, we're seeing a resurgence. But who knows? Hydrogen-powered cars might do to electric vehicles what gasoline cars did 100 years ago.<br>
                Google Glass in 2013 was ahead of its time. AR and wearable tech were still in their infancy, and users weren't ready for such a leap—social, technical, and financial barriers were too high. People wearing Google Glass were even banned from public places for privacy concerns. Fast forward to today: with AR and VR becoming mainstream, and wearable devices normalized, concepts like Google Glass are finally finding their moment. Just look at the reception of Apple Vision—society and technology are now ready.</p>
                <h2>3. Solving Other People's Problems</h2>
                <p>Ideas can also come from solving problems for others. Just make sure it's a problem you genuinely care about, one that excites you enough to spend significant time and energy working on it. This is because if your startup is successful, you will most likely have to spend 10 years on it.</p>
