                <p>Every great startup begins with a unique idea. Not the product, not the team, not executionâ€”those come later. Without a great idea, you're building a rocket with no destination. Excellent execution of a bad idea will guide you nowhere.</p>
                <p>Here's why the unique and great idea is crucial:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A Decade Commitment</strong><br>
                    If your startup succeeds, you'll likely spend the next 10 years on it. Therefore, it is important to choose an idea that you like. If you don't like the idea or don't believe in its success, there is a high probability of losing interest over time. If you have several ideas, choose the one that takes up the most time in your thoughts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your team needs a Mission. And a Mission requires a good Idea.</strong><br>
                    Your team needs to feel like they're building something important. This is the only way to achieve a high concentration of effort for a long period. It is also easier to get external support when working on a complex and important mission, rather than on something incomprehensible. And a mission requires a good idea.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>What idea to choose?</h2>
                <p>It is difficult for startups to start from superficial ideas. It is easier to take something fundamental. Many projects copy existing ones without any innovations, and such projects are not very interesting to people from an emotional point of view and are unable to inspire the team to full focus and dedication.<br>
                If the idea is very attractive - too many people will try to profit from it.<br>
                You need to take on an idea that a very limited number of teams are working on.<br>
                Ideally, you can show the external absurdity of your idea and show your approach to understanding its potential. Therefore, if your idea is criticized - it is good. It means that your critics will not be your competitors.</p>
